                  Space environment is a branch of astronautics, aerospace engineering and 
                  space physics which tries to understand and respond to the conditions 
                  existing in space that affect the design, construction and operation of a 
                  spacecraft. This also helps in ensuring safe passage of astronauts while on 
                  space missions. The effects on spacecraft arises mainly from outer space 
                  radiations, space debris, asteroids, meteoroids, friction, exposure to 
                  charged particles, etc. Space environments also refers to the environment 
                  that is present in the space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sources of radiations in space primarily include the Van Allen radiation 
                  belts, Solar Energetic Particles, Galactic Cosmic Rays. A Van Allen radiation
                  belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from 
                  the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that 
                  planet's magnetic field. Earth has two such belts. Solar energetic particles 
                  are high-energy particles coming from the sun. They consist of protons and 
                  electrons which have high levels of energy. Cosmic rays are high-energy 
                  protons and atomic nuclei which move through space at nearly the speed of 
                  light. They can originate from the Sun or from outside of the solar system 
                  and/or from distant galaxies. These radiations can severely damage the 
                  electronic components and solar cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds, causing 
                  mechanical or electrical damage. The average speed of space debris is 10 km/s 
                  while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater. Thousands of space 
                  debris are orbiting Earth at great speeds. The fragments as small as quarter 
                  of inch can cause immense damage to space crafts. Mechanical damage from 
                  debris impacts have been studied through space missions including LDEF (Long 
                  Duration Exposure Facility) by NASA which had over 20,000 documented impacts 
                  through its 5.7-year mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot plasma environment 
                  around the Earth. The plasma encountered in the region of the geostationary 
                  orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic substorms caused by disturbance in 
                  the solar wind, Hot electrons collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can 
                  establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts. As a result, 
                  discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft 
                  abnormalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With these there are many other challenges that a spacecraft faces when in 
                  space. These challenges are centred on three key themes: (1) Expand human 
                  presence in space, (2) Manage in-space resources, and (3) Enable 
                  transformational space exploration and scientific discovery. The challenges 
                  include space health and medicine, space colonization, affordable abundant 
                  power and surviving extreme space environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Space is an extreme environment that is not suitable for human beings. In 
                  order to live and effectively work in space for an extended the period of 
                  time, people require technologies that enable survival in extreme environment, 
                  comprehensive space-based physiological and physical health management and 
                  comprehensive medical care in a limited infrastructure. Currently, the 
                  infrastructure and integrated technologies needed to enable permanent, 
                  self-sufficient human settlements away from Earth do not exist. Effective 
                  systems do not exist to replenish consumable resources. This makes long term 
                  stays cost-prohibitive and poses significant risk to personnel if resupply
                  missions do not arrive on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mass and lifetime considerations of today's space power systems limit our 
                  missions. Current spacecraft power systems degrade over time, thereby 
                  reducing the amount of power available for use as the mission progresses. 
                  Space harbours extreme environments like extreme heat and cold, ultra-vacuum, 
                  gravitational value atomic oxygen, and high energy radiation, and all these 
                  affect machine operations and survival. To accomplish the goal of exploring a 
                  wide range of targets across our solar system requires the ability to survive 
                  extreme space environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Space environment affect the spacecraft through apart from others, 
                  microgravity, vacuum, and extreme temperature. The hard vacuum of space can 
                  cause deposits on the spacecraft's surface. This molecular contamination can
                  affect the optical properties of a vehicle and payload surfaces and spacecraft 
                  performance, especially for sensitive optics. The extreme temperature may lead 
                  to cracking, or formation of pinholes in the coating and/or surface material 
                  of the spacecraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The challenges of space environment will require truly radical improvement in 
                  all technologies to overcome it. The space environment challenges are not 
                  restricted to what spacecraft and astronauts encounter when they travel in 
                  space, but also it includes the asteroids, meteoroids and comets hurling at 
                  high speeds through the space and have a possibility of striking Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, it is critical for man to pursue deeper understanding of space 
                  environment so that he can learn more, harness space for growth and development 
                  of mankind and finally enable himself to protect this beautiful earth and life 
                  on it from extinction, or otherwise may meet the same fate that millions of 
                  years back dinosaurs faced in a meteor strike and perished. Therefore, it is 
                  important for mankind to continue expanding his boundaries in space while 
                  meeting its challenges technically and intelligently.
